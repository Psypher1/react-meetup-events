# React Meetup App with Firebase as backend

To futher familiarize

### Notes:

- Currently favourites data does not persist - an improvement would be to make it persist to either local storage or firebase
- Initial of build used fetch to grab data - that is commented out. Chnaged this to use async/await instead
